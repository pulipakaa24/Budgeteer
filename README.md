Simple Android App Allowing Expense Tracking, Final Project for CS50x 2020  
I have included the src folder, along with the Android Studio debug APK, as the rest is unnecessary.

# Info
This app provides the user with some base functionality for inputting their expenses and the categories in which they are spending money. The app shows a clear summary on the totals being spent on each area.

# Implementation
Uses a DAO to interface between a list activities containing expenditures and categories and a database storing all these.
